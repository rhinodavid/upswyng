      "More than a shelter, Mother House is a program that strives to build a young womanâ€™s confidence and skills for a successful future. It serves women who have made the decision to carry their baby to term, whether they decide to parent or choose adoption. Mother House is located in Boulder, Colorado.  Residents come primarily from Colorado, but we have had residents who were from other locations. Typically, the applicants arrive early in their pregnancy and stay until 3 months after the birth of their baby. Our facility can house up to 7 women and their babies.  It provides a family environment where women can participate in group living, which helps to give support and promote friendships that will hopefully last long after leaving Mother House.  We often invite our alumni back to visit with current residents and continue to offer our support when they might need it.",
